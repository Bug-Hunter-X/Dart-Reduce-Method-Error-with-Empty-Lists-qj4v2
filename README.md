# Dart Reduce Method and Empty Lists
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce` method in Dart with an empty list. The `reduce` method requires at least one element; attempting to use it on an empty list results in an exception.

The `bug.dart` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a solution using error handling.
